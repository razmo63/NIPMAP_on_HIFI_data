### NIPMAP_on_HIFI_data

#### Data acquisition 

The data input format is Hyperplexed Immunofluorescence Imaging (HIFI) on GBM samples from mice which is generated by Spencer Watscon from Joyce Lab in Lausanne (Watson et al., under review, 2023) which is not publicly available yet. Three CSV files representing three treatment groups—untreated, after 7 days of ionizing radiation (IR), and relapse, make up the HIFI data used in this project. 



#### Overview of the NIPMAP analysis and required data and packages.

                        " Analysis in Python3.7.13 "

* Required packages:
          
          
        matplotlib, scipy, pandas, numpy==1.8.1, scikit-learn, seaborn, qpsolvers==1.9.0, mpl_toolkits.
        *** The "NIPMAP (Required Packages)" folder provided in the GitHub link contains the NIPMAP package ***


* Required Data:

•	Input 1: CSV file named “patient<PatientID or number>_cell_positions.csv”
, includes four columns, containing the values of x and y coordinates of the cells, cell ID, and cell type. These columns have headers as the following: “x”, “y”, “label”, and “cell_type” respectively

* Analysis:

•	Calculation of sampling site cell composition using Gaussian kernel 
•	Generate sampling site and cell abundance (based on the radius value)
•	PCA and Archetype Analysis
•	Niche identification
•	Image segmentation into niches
•	Niche environments of cells


                              " Analysis in R 4.1.3 "


* Required packages:
     

          tidyverse (dplyr, purrr, ggplot2), RColorBrewer, rjson, readxl, plotly, grid, gridExtra
          *** The "NIPMAP (Required Packages)" folder provided in the GitHub link contains the NIPMAP package ***


* Required Data:

•	Input 2: CSV file named “cellData.csv”
, includes sample ID, cell ID, and the biomarkers intensity values used in the experiment. These headers must be named “SampleID”, “cellLabelInImage”, and the biomarkers names, such as marker1, marker2, etc... respectively.

* Analysis:

•	Niche-phenotype mapping
